 in the era of BLE, only Public Device Address is not enough, for the following reasons:
 1> Public Device Address needs to be purchased from IEEE. Although not expensive, in the BLE era, compared with the cost of BLE IC, it is still a small amount of overhead.
 2> The application and management of Public Device Address is quite tedious and complicated. In addition, the large number of BLE devices (not the same order of magnitude as 
 traditional Bluetooth devices) leads to increased maintenance costs.
 3> Security factors. A large part of the application scenario of BLE is broadcast communication, which means that as long as you know the address of the device, you can get 
 all the information, which is insecure. Therefore, the fixed device address increases the risk of information leakage.
 
 According to different purposes, Random Device Address is divided into Static Device Address and Private Device Address.
 >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Static Device Address <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
 The characteristics of Static Device Address can be summarized as:

1) The highest two bits are "11".
2) The remaining 46 bits are a random number and cannot be all 0s or 1s.
3) It remains unchanged during a power-up cycle.
4) It can be changed the next time it is powered on. But it is not mandatory, so it can remain the same. If changed, the last saved connection and other information will no 
longer be valid.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Private Device Address >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
Static Device Address solves some of the problems by randomly generating addresses. Private Device Address goes a step further and improves the reliability and security of 
Bluetooth addresses through regular update and address encryption. According to whether the address is encrypted, Private Device Address is divided into two categories, Non-
resolvable private address and Resolvable private address. Below we describe separately.
A> Non-resolvable private address
Same as Static Device Address but update in every after T_GAP period. Recommanded 15 mins 
1) The highest two bits are "00".
2) The remaining 46 bits are a random number and cannot be all 0s or 1s.
3) Take T_GAP (private_addr_int) as the period and update regularly.

B> Resolvable private address
Resolvable private address is more useful. It is generated by a random number and a password called identity resolving key (IRK), so it can only be scanned by devices with the 
same IRK, which can prevent scanning and tracking by unknown devices. The format is as follows:
LSB MSB
±-------------------------±--------------------- ±–±--+
| | Random part of prand | 1 | 0 |
±-------------------------±------ ---------------±--±--+

<--------+ hash ±--------> <-----------+ prand ±------>

hash = ah(IRK, prand).
