> SECURE SIMPLE PAIRING
There are five phases of Secure Simple Pairing: 
• Phase 1: Public key exchange
• Phase 2: Authentication Stage 1
• Phase 3: Authentication Stage 2
• Phase 4: Link key calculation
• Phase 5: LMP Authentication and Encryption
> Public key exchange
 Generate DH key
 > Authentication Stage 1
  Numeric Comparison, Out-of-Band, and Passkey Entry. The Just Works association model shares the  Numeric Comparison 
  protocol and does not have a separate protocol.
    The Out-of-Band Protocol is used when authentication information has been 
    received by at least one of the devices and indicated in the OOB Authentication 
    Data Present parameter in the LMP IO capability exchange sequence.
    The Passkey Entry protocol is used when LMP IO capability exchange 
    sequence indicates that Passkey Entry shall be used.
 > Authentication Stage 2
  identical in all three protocols.
  Each device computes a new confirmation value that includes the previously exchanged values and the newly derived shared key
