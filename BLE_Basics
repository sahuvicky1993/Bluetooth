ATT: Attribute protocol; a protocol for discovering, reading, and writing attributes on a peer device
  These attributes exposed by the server can be discovered, read, and written by a client, and can be indicated and notified by the server
  An attribute is a discrete value that has the three properties associated with it:
    1> attribute type, defined by a UUID 2> attribute handle 3> a set of permissions that are defined by each higher layer specification that utilizes the attribute;
    these permissions cannot be accessed using the Attribute protocol.
  
GATT: How to exchange all profile and user data over a BLE connection.
  GATT uses the Attribute Protocol as its transport protocol to exchange data between devices. This data is organized hierarchically in sections called services, which 
  group conceptually related pieces of user data called characteristics. This determines many fundamental aspects of GATT

GATT defines a few procedures for discovering the services from a GATT database located on a GATT Server. These procedures rely on Attribute Protocol (ATT) operations.
  One of those procedures is the Discover All Primary Services, which uses ATTâ€™s Read By Group Type request/response.
  The parameters for this request are:

    - The starting and the ending handle for the search.
    - The attribute type which is the UUID searched for.
  In order to discover all primary services, you need to set the starting handle to 0x0001, the ending handle to 0xFFFF (these are the minimum and maximum values for 
  attribute handles, so the search will be performed over the entire database) and the attribute type to 0x2800, which is the UUID for the <<Primary Service>> declaration
