Absolute Volume
AVRCP 1.4
Browsing
AVRCP 1.4
Browsing is done over a separate L2CAP channel, which is opened after the regular AVRCP channel has
been established. All regular AVRCP commands will still be sent over the regular AVRCP channel. The
browsing channel is only used for retrieving information about media on the Target device;
Every item on a browsing-capable player has a unique 128-bit UID that is valid over both AVRCP channels.
Any item discovered over the browsing channel can be addressed with regular AVRCP PDUs (for example,
PDU 0x74, PLAY_ITEM) by using the discovered UID.
Connect Browsing channel -> CONNECT 1 AVRCP 1b
