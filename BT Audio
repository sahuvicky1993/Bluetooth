SCO data Rate: 64 kbps
eSCO data Rate: As much as 288 Kbps

How to select Packet Type
  The specific packet type used is typically left up to the link manager firmware in the BT chip set, though there is a way to select a specific 
  type. Bluetooth defines four packet types for transmitting SCO data. Check Spec
  HV1 packets, while producing better error recovery than other types, accomplish this by consuming the entire bandwidth of a Bluetooth 1.1 connection.
  
Error Detection and Correction
  BT packet contains an access code, a header, and a payload. While a 1/3 forward-error-correction (FEC) code and an error-checking code protect the 
  header, low signal strength or local interference may result in a packet arriving with an invalid header. In this case, the entire packet is discarded. 
  Because there's no mechanism to request retransmission of an SCO packet, the data is simply lost.
  But in Case of eSCO (@ enhacement over SCO)
    1> packet contains a CRC code used to check the data's validity
    2> if an error is detected, the receiving device may be able to request retransmission of the faulty data.
