> ALSA stands for the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture
> A Typical Sound Application
Programs that use the PCM interface generally follow this pseudo-code:
  open interface for capture or playback
  set hardware parameters
  (access mode, data format, channels, rate, etc.)
  while there is data to be processed:
     read PCM data (capture)
     or write PCM data (playback)
  close interface
  
> Mono and Stereo
One digital value is called sample. More samples are collected to frames (frame is terminology for ALSA) depending on count of 
converters used at one specific time. One frame might contain one sample (when only one converter is used - mono) or more samples 
(for example: stereo has signals from two converters recorded at same time). Digital audio stream contains collection of frames 
recorded at boundaries of continuous time periods.

> Sound card
Sound cards use a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), which converts recorded or generated digital signal data into an analog format.
the sound card uses an analog-to-digital converter to digitize this signal.
